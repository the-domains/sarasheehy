As 2015 drew to a close I was enveloped in woodstove coziness with 
friends. After hugs to usher in a new year I ran through the below-zero 
night to my car. Curled over like a turtle I glanced upwards.

My breath caught. An infinity of crystal clear stars pierced the frigid air.

Stars produce a radical shift of scale. "You are there," they say. "And there is so much more."

Worries drop away under a blanket of stars. My place in the universe is tiny while simultaneously being everything I have.

A 90 year life drawn in dots [looks like this][0]. Time, a slippery concept, becomes concrete in the face of those dots. Years, months, weeks and days become finite.

If I'm so lucky to live 90 years over a third of my dots are already crossed off.

In those crossed off dots I've lost a parent. I've loved many times. 
I've chased after beauty and tried to capture it in a photograph. I've 
spent time with an inflated idea of my importance and spent time 
underestimating myself. I've squandered time and relished time. I've 
spent hundreds of nights sleeping under the stars.

56 dots. That's what remains.
