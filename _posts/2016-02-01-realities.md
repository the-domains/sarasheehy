Daughter universes, a theory of quantum mechanics, states that all 
possible outcomes of a situation play out in other universes. I woke up 
early today. From now on my life is influenced by that decision. A 
daughter universe was created where I slept in late, and my life is 
slightly different. Multiplying that by every decision I've made, 
conscious or not, gives me a canon of daughter universes.

Daughter universes suggest that the reality we live in is one of a 
near infinite number of realities in which we exist. Mind bending.

Perhaps in another universe I'm on a sailboat. Maybe I am buying 
flowers in Ljubljana Central Market. Perhaps I'm a dancer, a concert 
pianist or a politician. Maybe I'm homeless. Perhaps I have diabetes or 
maybe I am an Ironman.

My daughter universes, like yours, are unknowable. What I have is the
reality of the choices I've made, and the life that has been built from
them.

I live in the mountains. I have moved cross country multiple times. I
talk too fast. I have been photographing for over a decade, but never 
as a profession. I savor the title page of a new book. I fell in love 
with my college sweetheart. I seek out experiences and adventures. I'm 
afraid of uncertainty. I have two old dogs. I love beautiful things. I 
believe I'm capable of making an impact on this world.

Perhaps a choice I made led me into your path. Perhaps a choice you made led you into mine.

The power of daughter universes is the realization that each moment 
holds infinite possibilities. Each moment is an opportunity to alter the
course of a life.
