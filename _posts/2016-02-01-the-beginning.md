Well behaved blogs follow the rules. Single topic. Short posts. Digestible tutorials. I've been there before.

This blog is a bit different.

Nothing here is worthy of a glossy magazine spread. Nor will you find the raw and messy stories of everyday life.

In-between the extremes are pieces of my reality, thoughtfully scrutinized and put into words.

You'll find stories of adventure and the desire to lead an 
unconventional life. Stories of happiness, passion, disappointment, 
beauty and heartbreak.

Years of choices, chance and luck led me here. There are more paths ahead. Join me on the journey.
